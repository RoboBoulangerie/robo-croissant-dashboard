"""
Run programmatic auto-validation against all knowledge bases in the SQLite DB.

What this script does:
  1. Marks fields as auto_reviewed=1 when they pass vocabulary or URL checks.
  2. Writes detected data-quality issues to the `validation_issues` table so
     the dashboard can display them at /issues.
  3. Writes a human+LLM-readable feedback report to ./reports/ explaining
     what went wrong and how to fix it.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/validate_all.py
    python3 scripts/validate_all.py --dry-run          # preview, no writes
    python3 scripts/validate_all.py --kb "BRCA Exchange"  # single KB
    python3 scripts/validate_all.py --reset            # clear all auto_reviewed first
